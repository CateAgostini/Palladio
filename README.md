# Palladio
Palladio is a web-based tool for investigating and visualizing multi-dimensional data. In this workshop, we will learn to visualize humanistic research data on a map, and track connections between data points. Palladio is developed by Stanfordâ€™s Humanities + Design Lab.

Palladio has visualization and filtering functions, so that you can see both a panoramic overview of your area of study, and key points within the network, while also being able to add layers for other historical events, so that you can have the big picture and the fine details, too.
